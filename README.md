Collecting and analyzing data to improve restedness level from sleep.

Target Measures:
  1) Movement Level: Objective measure of overall amount of movement during sleep (higher = more movement).
  2) Restedness Level: Subjective measure of how rested I feel after waking up (higher = more rested).

Data Sources:
  1) 3 x Accelerometer: Track movement levels during sleep.
  2) Photoresistor: Track ambient light levels.
  3) Temperature/Humidity Sensor: Track temperature and humidity.
  4) Caffeine Consumption: Manually input amount of caffeine consumed and time of consumption.
  5) Duration of Sleep: Manually input the hours of sleep I had.
  
Hypotheses:
  1) Lower movement level correlates with increased restedness level.
  2) Movement level will be lower with lower ambient light levels.
  3) Movement level will be lower with temperatures in the low 60's Fahrenheit.
  4) Movement level will be lower with decreased amount of caffeine consumption.
  5) Movement level will be lower with longer time between consumption and sleep time.
  6) Higher duration of sleep will correlate with higher restedness level.
  
  
Progress:
  1) Equipment has arrived. Setting up sensors using an Arduino Uno for collection and a Jetston TX2 for analysis.

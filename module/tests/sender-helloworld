// First, load this script with Arduino and execute it.
// This script sends a message 'Hello, world!' over the serial port every 0.5 seconds.
// Then, load the 'receiver-helloworld' script with Processing and follow its instructions.
// At the end, you'll have the correct serial port that Arduino and Processing communicate over.

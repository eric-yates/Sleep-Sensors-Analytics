Photoresistor, 3 x MPU6050 accelerometer, ribbon cable, and soldering kit arrived.
  
11/10/17
  
Tested photoresistor with Arduino & LED. Script: tests/photoresistor-led.

Soldered right-angle header onto one accelerometer. 

Connected accelerometer with Arduino by flat ribbon cable.
  VCC -> 3.3V
  GND -> GND
  SCL -> A5
  SDA -> A4
  ADO -> GND
  INT -> D2
  
Tested accelerometer for raw data. Script: tests/accelerometer-test.
Tested accelerometer for a base to be built on top of. Script: tests/accelerometer-base.

Downloaded i2cdevlib.
  Home: https://www.i2cdevlib.com/devices/mpu6050#source
  Documentation: https://www.i2cdevlib.com/docs/html/class_m_p_u6050.html
  Source: https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib

Moved I2Cdev and MPU6050 libraries from i2cdevlib to ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries.

Simultaneously measured data from an accelerometer and photoresistor. Script: main/base.

11/13/17

DHT-22 temperature/humidity sensor arrived.

11/15/17

Tested DHT-22 sensor for raw data. Script: /tests/dht22-test.

Updated 'main/base' script to take temperature/humidity readings from a DHT-22 sensor.
Now, the script simultaneously measures acceleration, brightness, temperature, and humidity.

Installed Processing to handle data on computer side.
  https://processing.org/

Connected Arduino to Processing. Scripts: tests/sender-helloworld Arduino), tests/receiver-helloworld (Processing).
Arduino and Processing connect over serial port 2 for my Mac.

Edited and renamed 'main/base' script to 'main/base-arduino'.
Created a list of all data called sensorVals and sent it over serial port, seperated by commas.
  
Created a 'main/base-processing' script to capture Arduino data with Processing.
This saves the data in sensorVals to CSV.
